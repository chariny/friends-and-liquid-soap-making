        <p id="dog">its been ten years now buliding what we have and i remember the days in school when we used to fight even over pety
            issues.i have watched us grow to this stage and i know how far we have come from, the journey is so long but
            its still going...... l-lcan never forget our teacher lawernce and our sturbborn friend Mariam that evening when
            trouble came our way,the punishments,oooh GOD. Those were some of the days we had...we could just mind abut books
            eating and playing by then thats all we needed for life to be sweet what a childhood
        </p>

            Now we are far away from each other but communication does it. days are folding and time is passing by but still the bold
            is more stronger than never stonger than the conrete.As God is with us we expect all the success to come although
            they are now struggles we are still dreaming big
